# PREFIX MATCHING BASED AUTOCOMPLETE

Here we are creating a simple autocomplete system using a flask api and sql for storage, redis for a cache system and MISTRAL LLM as a fallback mechanism.

## WHAT DO I NEED?

#### DO I NEED AN API KEY?

Yes. We are using MISTRAL LLM here so we would need an API key. But of course you could use other LLMs too. Just make sure to change the prompt schema according to the LLMs conventions

#### WHAT IS OPENDATASETS AND HOW DID YOU DOWNLOAD THE DATASET?

OPENDATASETS is a library used to download data from kaggle. Keep in mind that you need to generate a kaggle username and kaggle key which you will be asked to enter when you download the dataset.
